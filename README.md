# ChatClient
A text-based instant messaging client to practice network programming

# Usage
Let's wait until we have something close to working to write this.

# Goals

Here are some goals I think we should try to implement with ones that I suspect to
be easier closer to the top, but not in a strict order.
1. A simple, no-security client where exactly two nodes can share text-based messages.
2. Allow multiple nodes to communicate in a multi-party conversation. One node may act as a central server.
3. Allow encryption and authentication among chatting nodes.
4. Make the network P2P.
